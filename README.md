# Lichess-Autoplay-Bot
A bot to automatically play moves for the Lichess interface.
The bot itself does not calculate the optimal moves. It is meant to act as an interface between engine and user.

The bot provides options for the user - the time taken per move and chess engine for calculations. After this setup, the user simply has to enter the color and the bot does the rest.

Note: the bot has been calibrated to play on Lichess only on 1 local machine. There are constant values such as resolution and paths which change from device to device. These changes need to be made to ensure the program runs without issues on other devices.
